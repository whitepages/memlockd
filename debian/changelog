memlockd (1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Use wheezy paths for shared objects on i386 and amd64.  Also added a new
    config file option to not log file not found errors so we don't see i386
    errors on amd64 and amd64 errors on i386.
    Closes: #660321, #480915
  * Added systemd service file.
    Closes: #652386
  * Added a run-parts style config directory, default is /etc/memlock.d and
    the config file uses a % to chain to another file or directory.
    Closes: #529265

memlockd (0.03) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed section and description.

  * Made it write a pidfile, and also made the restart option of the init.d
    script start a new instance unconditionally so the new instance can kill
    the old.  This means that there is no window where memlockd is not
    running.
