memlockd (0.03) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed section and description.

  * Made it write a pidfile, and also made the restart option of the init.d
    script start a new instance unconditionally so the new instance can kill
    the old.  This means that there is no window where memlockd is not
    running.

memlockd (0.02) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Made it not recursively call ldd.  ldd does recursion.
