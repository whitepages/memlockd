.TH memlockd 8
.SH NAME
memlockd \- daemon to lock files in memory with mlock
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3memlockd\f1 [ \f3\-c config-file\f1 ] [ \f3\-d\f1 ] [ \f3\-u user\f1 ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B memlockd
command.
.P
It is used to lock system programs and config files in memory so that if a
DOS attack is experienced then the chance of the sys\-admin regaining
control of the system in a reasonable amount of time (and therefore having
a reasonable chance of discovering the cause of the problem) is significantly
increased.
.SH OPTIONS
The \f3\-c\f1 option is used to specify the fully-qualified path name to a
config file that lists the names of files to lock, if the config file is not
specified then it will default to \f3/etc/memlockd.cfg\f1.

The \f3\-d\f1 option specifies debugging mode, the program will not fork
and will produce it's logging messages on stderr instead of via syslog.

The \f3\-u\f1 option specifies the name of a user to use for running ldd (for
recursive operation).  Note that locking shared objects that are writable by
non\-root is not safe, but using a different UID will reduce the risk.

The config file will contain a number of fully qualified names of files to
lock in RAM.  When locking shared objects and ELF binaries it is possible to
prefix the file name with a \f3+\f1 character to indicate that memlockd should
recursively lock all shared objects that the program requires and all shared
objects that those objects require.
